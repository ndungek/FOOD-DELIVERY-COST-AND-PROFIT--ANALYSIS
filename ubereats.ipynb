    "## **PROJECT PROPOSAL**\n",
    "### *Executive Summary*\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis of Uber Eats data is geared towards extracting valuable insights into customer preferences within the food industry. We're looking at how much restaurants charge, their ratings, the types of food they offer, and where they're located. Our aim? Provide straightforward tips to help these places get noticed more on the platform and make more money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing this data helps us spot trends and patterns in the food scene. Our main goal is to provide practical recommendations that can reshape restaurant strategies and enhance their visibility on the Uber Eats platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Problem Statement*\n",
    "Our main mission in this project is to provide practical guidance to clients planning to start a new restaurant chain or enhance the performance of their existing establishments. We're dealing with a widespread issue in the restaurant industry, where profit margins typically fall within the range of 10-20%. Our analysis is centered around exploring the current landscape of Uber Eats, aiming to uncover inventive strategies that can make restaurant businesses more attractive to both new and existing customers, ultimately driving higher profits."

    "# **WHY DOES THIS MATTER!?**\n",
    "The significance of this problem stems from the remarkable growth of online food ordering platforms, exemplified by Uber Eats' substantial transaction surge. In 2022, Uber Eats recorded a staggering USD 11 billion in revenue, marking a notable 31% increase from the previous year's revenue of $8.3 billion. Concurrently, there has been a steady 2% growth in user numbers, with a significant 10% increase in merchant participation in the US. These trends underscore the platform's rising popularity among both customers and merchants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Central to this challenge is understanding customer preferences across various dimensions, including preferred cuisines and menu diversity, within different regions. Thus, the pivotal question emerges: How can restaurants effectively analyze customer preferences to craft strategies that capitalize on the burgeoning potential of online food ordering platforms?"

    "*Merging Datasets:*\n",

    "\n",
    "*Deriving New Attributes:*\n",

    "*Data Cleaning:*\n",

We will employ techniques such as imputation, deletion, outlier detection, and data validation to ensure the integrity and quality of our dataset.\n",

    "EDA plays a vital role in understanding the underlying patterns, trends, and relationships within our data. We will perform exploratory data analysis to visualize distributions, examine correlations, detect patterns, and gain insights into the characteristics of our dataset.

This approach allows us to address data inconsistencies, missing values, duplicates, outliers, and other quality issues specific to each dataset. By cleaning the datasets individually, we can ensure data integrity and consistency before merging. Additionally, considering differences in data sizes and structures among datasets, cleaning them separately facilitates more focused and efficient data cleaning efforts. Once each dataset is cleaned and standardized, we will proceed with merging them to create a comprehensive dataset for further analysis."

    "By segmenting restaurant pricing into three categories - cheap, average, and high-end - we gain insight into menu pricing disparities across regions. Across all regions, the majority of restaurants fall within the average price range. However, a closer examination of the quantity distribution among these categories reveals a notable trend in the southwest region, where the concentration is notably skewed towards the average price bracket. This nuanced understanding of market segmentation can inform strategic pricing decisions, empowering restaurants to differentiate themselves through competitive pricing strategies, such as offering below-average prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the northeast region exhibits a higher proportion of high-end priced restaurants compared to cheaper options. This suggests a consumer base in this region willing to invest in premium dining experiences, even when ordering food for delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the visualization illustrates the distribution of various price categories across different regions in the USA:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cheap Prices Category:** Restaurants offering meals priced below or equal to $7.64.\n",
    "- **Average Prices Category:** Establishments with prices ranging between $7.64 - $14.29.\n",
    "- **High-End Prices Category:** Restaurants with prices above or equal to $14.29.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data underscores the dominance of restaurants falling within the 'Average Prices Category' across all regions, while also highlighting regional variations in consumer preferences and willingness to pay for food delivery services."
